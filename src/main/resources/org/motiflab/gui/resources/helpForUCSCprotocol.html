    <h1>UCSC protocol</h1>
    The UCSC protocol will retrieve data from the UCSC Genome Browser API at <span style="color:blue"><tt> https://api.genome.ucsc.edu</tt></span><br>
    <br><br>
    For <i>DNA sequence</i> tracks, you can choose to fetch all DNA bases in uppercase letters or represent <i>repeat regions</i> in the sequence with lowercase letters.
    <br><br>
    For <i>numeric data tracks</i>, the name of the track must be specified with a <b>track</b> parameter, e.g. "phastCons100way".
    <br><br>
    For <i>region tracks</i>, not only must the name of the track be specified with the <b>track</b> parameter,
    but since the names used internally in the UCSC database for the standard region properties (<b>start</b>, <b>end</b>, <b>type</b>, <b>strand</b> and <b>score</b>)
    varies from track to track, the names used for these properties must also be specified.
    In addition, it is possible to specify <b>extra</b> parameters to be included in the annotation of regions.
    This is done with a comma-separated list of key=value pairs, where the key is the name of an internal property available for that track in the UCSC database 
    and the value is the name you would like to use for this property in MotifLab. 
    (If you double-click on a region, you will see these listed under "Additional Properties", and they will also be displayed in the tooltip if you hover the mouse over a region.)
