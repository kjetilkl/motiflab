textArea.text=Press the "Open File" button above to import an XML configuration file into\nthis panel, and/or edit the contents of the XML-document directly in the panel.\n\nThe XML-file should contain one or more <DataTrack> elements\nwith at least one <DataSource> each. Press the HELP-button above\nto view the documentation on how data sources should be defined\nin the XML-format. <DataTrack> elements referring to new tracks\nwill be added to the configuration. If a track already exists,\nthe source(s) defined in the XML-file can either replace the\ncurrent source(s) or be added as additional mirror sources.\n \nWhen you are ready, press the "OK" button to parse the contents\nand add the datatracks and sources to your configuration.\n\n
