          PRIORITY is a software package for de novo motif discovery. Its goal is to incorporate informative position-based priors into a collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm.
          &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
          &lt;b&gt;MOTIFLAB NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; The stand-alone version of PRIORITY includes some additional functionality which have been hidden in the bundled version for compatibility reasons, for instance the possiblity of using different positional priors for each motif when searching for multiple motifs. In MotifLab the same priors track will be used for each motif searched, which increases the chance of reporting duplicate motifs.
