modeCombobox.toolTipText=<html>\nThe selection made in this box controls how MotifLab should react if the configuration<br>\nimported from file contains tracks that have the same name as existing tracks.\n<ol>\n<li><b>Replace all sources for existing tracks</b>.<br>\nThis will delete all the existing sources for the track and only the new sources will be used.</li>\n<li><b>Replace conflicting sources</b>.<br>\nNewly imported sources will replace any existing sources that have the same <i>origin</i><br>\n(same organism/genome build), but other non-conflicting sources will be kept.</li>\n<li><b>Add new sources as primary</b>.<br>\nAll sources will be kept, but the newly imported sources will treated as "primary sources"<br>\nand be given priority over the existing ones (which will be treated as "mirrors").</li>\n<li><b>Add new sources as mirrors</b>.<br>\nAll sources will be kept, but the existing sources will be treated as "primary sources"<br>\nand be given priority over the newly imported ones (which will be treated as "mirrors").</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe four options above will keep the existing track (including its metadata), but merge or replace the existing and new sources.<br>\nIf the imported track is of a different type than the existing track, the new sources will not be added since they are not compatible.<br>\n(e.g. if trying to import a region track named "Conservation" but the current configuration already contains a numeric track with the same name).<br>\nHowever, by selecting <b>replace existing tracks</b>, newly imported tracks will replace any current tracks with the same name<br>\n(and the existing sources will then be lost).\n<br>\nThe final option, <b>replace whole configuration</b> will discard all existing tracks and server settings and only use the new imported settings.\n</html>
